MeasureGranularity
==================
**MeasureGranularity** outputs spectra of size measurements of the
textures in the image.

Image granularity is a texture measurement that tries to fit a series of
structure elements of increasing size into the texture of the image and outputs a spectrum of measures
based on how well they fit.
Granularity is measured as described by Ilya Ravkin (references below).

Basically, MeasureGranularity:
1 - Downsamples the image (if you tell it to). This is set in
**Subsampling factor for granularity measurements** or **Subsampling factor for background reduction**.
2 - Background subtracts anything larger than the radius in pixels set in
**Radius of structuring element.**
3 - For as many times as you set in **Range of the granular spectrum**, it gets rid of bright areas
that are only 1 pixel across, reports how much signal was lost by doing that, then repeats.
i.e. The first time it removes one pixel from all bright areas in the image,
(effectively deleting those that are only 1 pixel in size) and then reports what % of the signal was lost.
It then takes the first-iteration image and repeats the removal and reporting (effectively reporting
the amount of signal that is two pixels in size). etc.

    1. (Outcommented) Subsample image

    3.  Calculate granular spectrum (size distribution) for all masks

    Parameters
    ----------
    subsample_size : float, optional
        Subsampling factor for granularity measurements.
        If the textures of interest are larger than a few pixels, we recommend
        you subsample the image with a factor <1 to speed up the processing.
        Downsampling the image will let you detect larger structures with a
        smaller sized structure element. A factor >1 might increase the accuracy
        but also require more processing time. Images are typically of higher
        resolution than is required for granularity measurements, so the default
        value is 0.25. For low-resolution images, increase the subsampling
        fraction; for high-resolution images, decrease the subsampling fraction.
        Subsampling by 1/4 reduces computation time by (1/4) :sup:`3` because the
        size of the image is (1/4) :sup:`2` of original and the range of granular
        spectrum can be 1/4 of original. Moreover, the results are sometimes
        actually a little better with subsampling, which is probably because
        with subsampling the individual granular spectrum components can be used
        as features, whereas without subsampling a feature should be a sum of
        several adjacent granular spectrum components. The recommendation on the
        numerical value cannot be determined in advance; an analysis as in this
        reference may be required before running the whole set. See this `pdf`_,
        slides 27-31, 49-50.

        .. _pdf:     http://www.ravkin.net/presentations/Statistical%20properties%20of%20algorithms%20for%20analysis%20of%20cell%20images.pdf"

    image_sample_size : float, optional
        Subsampling factor for background reduction.
        It is important to remove low frequency image background variations as
        they will affect the final granularity measurement. Any method can be
        used as a pre-processing step prior to this module; we have chosen to
        simply subtract a highly open image. To do it quickly, we subsample the
        image first. The subsampling factor for background reduction is usually
        [0.125 – 0.25]. This is highly empirical, but a small factor should be
        used if the structures of interest are large. The significance of
        background removal in the context of granulometry is that image volume
        at certain granular size is normalized by total image volume, which
        depends on how the background was removed.

    element_size : int, optional
        Radius of structuring element.
        This radius should correspond to the radius of the textures of interest
        *after* subsampling; i.e., if textures in the original image scale have
        a radius of 40 pixels, and a subsampling factor of 0.25 is used, the
        structuring element size should be 10 or slightly smaller, and the range
        of the spectrum defined below will cover more sizes.

    granular_spectrum_length : int, optional
        Range of the granular spectrum.
        You may need a trial run to see which granular
        spectrum range yields informative measurements. Start by using a wide
        spectrum and narrow it down to the informative range to save time.

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary of 1-d arrays where each value contains the specific granularity feature for a given cells.
