# Measurement notes

For essential input and performance guidance, see the [README](../README.md#important-notes). For dimensions, label requirements, empty masks, and Feret batch shapes, see the [measurement support table](measurement-support.md).

## 3D size and shape

The featurizer supports both single- and multichannel volumes with `is_3d=True`. Both images `(B, C, Z, Y, X)` and masks `(B, M, Z, Y, X)` must have all five axes, with matching batch size and spatial dimensions. A 2D mask stack is rejected; singleton spatial axes are not stretched.

To use a 2D mask through a volume, the caller must explicitly repeat it before calling `featurize`, for example `masks_3d = np.repeat(masks_2d[:, :, None], image.shape[2], axis=2)`. Each repeated label becomes one 3D object, so intensity and shape measurements use the entire volume rather than separate 2D measurements per slice. The featurizer does not perform this conversion or modify its inputs.

The existing `sizeshape` measurement uses a surface-area calculation that requires at least two voxels along each spatial axis. In particular, a single-slice volume (`Z=1`) raises `ValueError: Input array must be at least 2x2x2.` with size/shape enabled. Disable it with `make_featurizer_config(..., sizeshape=False)`, or explicitly provide a 2D batch and use `is_3d=False` if 2D measurements are intended. This limitation predates the batch featurizer.

## Texture quantization

Intensities use a fixed image-wide mapping, not per-object min/max scaling. Dim variation can disappear, and pairs containing zero are excluded. See the [#100 explanation](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/100#issuecomment-5939719548) and [`get_texture` Notes](../src/cp_measure/core/measuretexture.py) for CellProfiler compatibility and zero/NaN behavior.

## Legacy percentile convention

`legacy=True` restores the original intensity quantile conventions; the default uses NumPy's linear quartiles and the usual median absolute deviation. See the [`get_intensity` docstring](../src/cp_measure/core/measureobjectintensity.py#L139-L163) for formulas, including the different legacy MAD convention in 3D.

## Costes integer-to-float normalization

For integer images, Costes divides by `scale_max`; normalized floats require the same scale explicitly. Equivalent floating-point expressions such as `level / scale_max` and `level * (1 / scale_max)` can differ at round-off, which can otherwise change threshold decisions substantially (see [#117](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/117)).

Both public Costes functions recognize **exact** reciprocal-multiply encodings of integer acquisition-grid levels, as produced by `img_as_float`, and map them to the existing division encoding before fitting thresholds and computing coefficients. This is performed per object, without modifying caller inputs. Other float values are left unchanged: there is no blanket quantization or epsilon-based snapping of nearby values. Explicit lower-bit-depth scales, such as `4095` for 12-bit images in `uint16`, use the same rule.

This resolves conversion-path differences for these grid encodings; it does not promise continuity for genuinely different pixel values, identical results across floating-point precisions, or equivalence between different Costes search modes. Existing threshold comparisons and undefined-result/NaN rules are unchanged.

## Singleton-Z measurement eligibility

The 2D-only families (`radial_distribution`, `radial_zernikes`, shape `zernike`, and `feret`) use their 2D calculations when there is exactly one Z slice. They are not computed when there is more than one Z slice.

- Matching `(Y, X)` inputs use the 2D measurements as usual.
- Matching `(1, Y, X)` inputs use the 2D measurements on their sole slice.
- Matching `(Z, Y, X)` inputs with `Z > 1` return an empty result (`{}`).
- Apply the same rule per image in list/tuple and `(B, Z, Y, X)` batches: `Z=1` is measured; `Z>1` is not.

The same eligibility rule applies in both backends and through the featurizer. NumPy raw functions remain per-image APIs; Numba also accepts batches. Labels and intensities must match for intensity-dependent features; do not repeat masks through Z or select the first slice of a multi-slice volume.

This does not reinterpret the input as 2D for other measurements. Intensity, texture, granularity, size/shape, and colocalization keep their 3D input and existing conventions. In particular, the size/shape singleton-axis limitation above remains. Granularity's Numba backend uses the NumPy 3D path for singleton-Z volumes instead of silently selecting its 2D kernel.

## Radial-distribution centers

Center ties use the first pixel in C order, so symmetric objects may differ from older releases. See [#22 discussion](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/22). Intensities are accumulated in float64 by both backends, avoiding integer overflow.

Labels and intensities must have matching shapes and spatial rank. Singleton-Z and multi-slice eligibility is specified above. Bin counts must be non-negative integers. For nonempty 2D inputs with zero or NaN unscaled radii, the Numba wrapper delegates to the NumPy reference: its non-finite-to-integer bin conversion can produce results or raise depending on the installed NumPy/platform. These exceptional inputs never reach the unchecked kernel; regular radii remain accelerated.

## Radial Zernike inputs and phases

Radial Zernikes measure one intensity channel at a time. For a 2D label image `(Y, X)`, pass a matching 2D intensity image. Both backends reject mismatched shapes, including `(C, Y, X)` or `(1, Y, X)` intensities paired with a 2D mask, rather than selecting the first plane. This also applies to 2D entries in list/tuple batches. Stacked singleton-Z batches use matching `(B, 1, Y, X)` arrays. The same eligibility rule applies to individual volume masks: use the 2D measurements for `Z=1`, and return an empty result for `Z>1`.

Phases follow CellProfiler's `arctan2(real, imag)` convention, not the usual reversed argument order. Compare meaningful phases modulo `2π`: `+π` and `-π` represent the same angle. Near-zero moments have numerically unstable phases, which can differ across backends, platforms, or even repeated NumPy calls. NumPy-computed azimuthal powers reduce these differences in the Numba backend but do not guarantee identical phases.

Backend parity tests compare finite moments' phases only when their magnitude exceeds `1e-9` times the largest finite magnitude **of the same object**, with wrapped angular tolerance `1e-6` radians. This object-local threshold prevents a bright or nonfinite object from hiding phase errors in another object. Magnitudes and phase NaN patterns are checked regardless of the threshold. These are comparison rules only: returned phases are not rounded, zeroed, or masked.

## Floating-point differences

Some features differ by approximately `1e-16` when using one versus multiple masks. See the [#18 explanation](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/18#issuecomment-4593709963) for the upstream centrosome discrepancy.

## Numba colocalization

Pearson, Manders and RWC keep the same default bulk feature names and ordering as
NumPy. Overlap/K remains available through the direct module API only. RWC ranks
pixels independently within each object; changing another object's signal does
not change these ranks.

The accelerated float64 path groups paired pixels once per measurement and uses
a fused kernel. Pearson retains NumPy's mean reductions, including their behavior
for constant signals. Other pixel dtypes explicitly use the NumPy implementation:
float32 threshold membership and integer multiplication overflow must not change
just because an accelerator is selected. Undefined outputs also use the reference
path to preserve warnings and errors (including the existing zero-denominator
Overlap/K error). These compatibility paths are not advertised as accelerated.

All three inputs must have matching spatial ranks and extents. A 2D mask is not
broadcast over Z, nor is the first intensity plane selected implicitly. Matching
singleton-Z inputs are supported. Direct functions require contiguous labels;
bulk sanitation handles arbitrary IDs. Missing raw label slots retain NumPy's
zero values.

Two independent follow-ups are deliberately not included here:

- [#124](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/pull/124) restores array-valued
  float32 threshold arithmetic. Its boundary fixture currently retains the
  installed NumPy generation's baseline result in both backends. Once that fix
  lands, the dtype compatibility path will inherit it without a separate JIT
  threshold policy.
- [#126](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/pull/126) adds an opt-in
  `rank_scope="object_set"`. This backend retains the current signature and
  ordinary object-local default; that follow-up will also need to add keyword
  forwarding to the Numba wrapper (with a reference path for the new scope, or
  a separately validated implementation). It must not silently change the default.

### Costes

The Numba Costes wrapper accepts the same `scale_max`, `fast_costes` and unused
`thr` parameters as NumPy. Normalized floats require an explicit acquisition
maximum; same-dtype unsigned integers infer their storage maximum. Integer
normalization uses the shared NumPy preparation, not the old dtype-derived
`scale=1` float shortcut. All three search modes are supported.

NumPy regression and coefficient reductions surround the compiled threshold
search. This preserves threshold inclusion: even last-bit changes in the fitted
line can change the result substantially. Constant/nonfinite or insufficient
signals retain NaN results and standard `RuntimeWarning` diagnostics. Missing
raw Costes labels likewise yield NaN and warnings, unlike the zero-valued slots
of the other colocalization metrics. Undefined searches are replayed per object
by the reference to preserve precise diagnostics. Near-constant subsets and
correlations within a reduction-error bound of a search decision also use this
compatibility path; no correlation is rounded or search cutoff moved.

Both backends call the same per-object normalization canonicalization before
validation, regression and threshold search. Exact reciprocal-multiply
acquisition-grid encodings therefore follow the same division encoding in the
NumPy and Numba paths; arbitrary off-grid floats are unchanged. This is the
normalization rule described above, not an epsilon-based threshold adjustment.

No fused `get_correlation_all` dispatch is introduced. Costes supports matching
2D, singleton-Z and true 3D inputs, and the existing explicit batch convention;
it does not repeat masks or select an intensity plane implicitly.
