# Measurement notes

For essential input and performance guidance, see the [README](../README.md#important-notes). For dimensions, label requirements, empty masks, and Feret batch shapes, see the [measurement support table](measurement-support.md).

## 3D size and shape

The featurizer supports both single- and multichannel volumes with `is_3d=True`. Both images `(B, C, Z, Y, X)` and masks `(B, M, Z, Y, X)` must have all five axes, with matching batch size and spatial dimensions. A 2D mask stack is rejected; singleton spatial axes are not stretched.

To use a 2D mask through a volume, the caller must explicitly repeat it before calling `featurize`, for example `masks_3d = np.repeat(masks_2d[:, :, None], image.shape[2], axis=2)`. Each repeated label becomes one 3D object, so intensity and shape measurements use the entire volume rather than separate 2D measurements per slice. The featurizer does not perform this conversion or modify its inputs.

The existing `sizeshape` measurement uses a surface-area calculation that requires at least two voxels along each spatial axis. In particular, a single-slice volume (`Z=1`) raises `ValueError: Input array must be at least 2x2x2.` with size/shape enabled. Disable it with `make_featurizer_config(..., sizeshape=False)`, or explicitly provide a 2D batch and use `is_3d=False` if 2D measurements are intended. This limitation predates the batch featurizer.

## Texture quantization

Intensities use a fixed image-wide mapping, not per-object min/max scaling. Dim variation can disappear, and pairs containing zero are excluded. See the [#100 explanation](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/100#issuecomment-5939719548) and [`get_texture` Notes](../src/cp_measure/core/measuretexture.py) for CellProfiler compatibility and zero/NaN behavior.

## Legacy percentile convention

`legacy=True` restores the original intensity quantile conventions; the default uses NumPy's linear quartiles and the usual median absolute deviation. See the [`get_intensity` docstring](../src/cp_measure/core/measureobjectintensity.py#L139-L163) for formulas, including the different legacy MAD convention in 3D.

## Singleton-Z measurement eligibility

The 2D-only families (`radial_distribution`, `radial_zernikes`, shape `zernike`, and `feret`) use their 2D calculations when there is exactly one Z slice. They are not computed when there is more than one Z slice.

- Matching `(Y, X)` inputs use the 2D measurements as usual.
- Matching `(1, Y, X)` inputs use the 2D measurements on their sole slice.
- Matching `(Z, Y, X)` inputs with `Z > 1` return an empty result (`{}`).
- Apply the same rule per image in list/tuple and `(B, Z, Y, X)` batches: `Z=1` is measured; `Z>1` is not.

The same eligibility rule applies in both backends and through the featurizer. NumPy raw functions remain per-image APIs; Numba also accepts batches. Labels and intensities must match for intensity-dependent features; do not repeat masks through Z or select the first slice of a multi-slice volume.

This does not reinterpret the input as 2D for other measurements. Intensity, texture, granularity, size/shape, and colocalization keep their 3D input and existing conventions. In particular, the size/shape singleton-axis limitation above remains. Granularity's Numba backend uses the NumPy 3D path for singleton-Z volumes instead of silently selecting its 2D kernel.

## Radial-distribution centers

Center ties use the first pixel in C order, so symmetric objects may differ from older releases. See [#22 discussion](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/22). Intensities are accumulated in float64 by both backends, avoiding integer overflow.

Labels and intensities must have matching shapes and spatial rank. Singleton-Z and multi-slice eligibility is specified above. Bin counts must be non-negative integers. For nonempty 2D inputs with zero or NaN unscaled radii, the Numba wrapper delegates to the NumPy reference: its non-finite-to-integer bin conversion can produce results or raise depending on the installed NumPy/platform. These exceptional inputs never reach the unchecked kernel; regular radii remain accelerated.

## Radial Zernike inputs and phases

Radial Zernikes measure one intensity channel at a time. For a 2D label image `(Y, X)`, pass a matching 2D intensity image. Both backends reject mismatched shapes, including `(C, Y, X)` or `(1, Y, X)` intensities paired with a 2D mask, rather than selecting the first plane. This also applies to 2D entries in list/tuple batches. Stacked singleton-Z batches use matching `(B, 1, Y, X)` arrays. The same eligibility rule applies to individual volume masks: use the 2D measurements for `Z=1`, and return an empty result for `Z>1`.

Phases follow CellProfiler's `arctan2(real, imag)` convention, not the usual reversed argument order. Compare meaningful phases modulo `2π`: `+π` and `-π` represent the same angle. Near-zero moments have numerically unstable phases, which can differ across backends, platforms, or even repeated NumPy calls. NumPy-computed azimuthal powers reduce these differences in the Numba backend but do not guarantee identical phases.

Backend parity tests compare finite moments' phases only when their magnitude exceeds `1e-9` times the largest finite magnitude **of the same object**, with wrapped angular tolerance `1e-6` radians. This object-local threshold prevents a bright or nonfinite object from hiding phase errors in another object. Magnitudes and phase NaN patterns are checked regardless of the threshold. These are comparison rules only: returned phases are not rounded, zeroed, or masked.

## Floating-point differences

Some features differ by approximately `1e-16` when using one versus multiple masks. See the [#18 explanation](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measure/issues/18#issuecomment-4593709963) for the upstream centrosome discrepancy.
